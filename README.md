## Convolutional Neural Network Based Ensemble Approach for Homoglyph Recognition

1. First download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LF4A6daY0loiCYEsp_TzGH5PpNaSZB3a). 
2. Go above your current directory
3. Create a folder named "DataSet"
4. Paste the folder named "Custom" (which you just downloaded) inside it. 
5. run: "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your shell.
6. go back to the main directory
7. run: python scratch1.py
8. run: python scratch2.py 
9. After you have properly trained a good model (>98% accuracy on validation set), download final test dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Vxbsrc9PeMnLTgFBMZC6rWNykxAm66Hz)
10. Code for testing an image can be found as commented out in line: 325-355 in scratch1.py file.
11. Code for testing an image can be found as commented out in line: 261-390 in scratch2.py file.
